#### Summary
>This repository is holding experiments related to my M.Tech thesis.
The project is aiming to address the road extraction problem in 
>an end-to-end fashion. Our dataset is a set of aerial images taken 
>from UAV(drones) from local areas within the NIT Rourkela campus. 
>Throughout the experiments, we are benchmarking different 
>state-of-the-art models and taking advantage of the techniques being used to tackle our problem. 
>The main objective of this project is to build an effective CNN model, 
>being able to distinguish roads from occlusion and background and able 
>to generalize to later extension as well as to build our own dataset. 

> **Please note:** the development is undergoing and details will 
> gradually be provided below. 

## Install required libraries
There are a few important dependencies which need to be installed before making any change in pre-processing or expermenting the models.
Note that the code has been tested using `python==3.6.7`. 
```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Few parameters(environment variables) have to be set according to the need.
* In `train.sh` and `predict.sh`
```bash
export PRE_TRAINED=True   # set to False if not loading the pre-trained weight 
export WEIGHTS_IN_PATH=path/to/the/weights.h5    # full path of the weight
``` 

### Create new [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html) environment 
```bash
conda create --name ENV_NAME python=3.6.7
source activate ENV_NAME
```

### Dataset directory structure
* `/input` contains images/frames and their respective masks within each 
set(training/validation/testing). Within `mask`, the ground truth set would be a Tensor of dimension `(height x width)` and each pixel's value maps the spatial distribution of the respective label. 

```bash
/input
├── testing # Testing data 
│   ├── images
│   └── mask
├── training   # Training data 
│   ├── images
│   └── mask
└── validation # Validation data
    ├── images
    └── mask
```
* `/output` contains predicted masks referred from input/prediction along with their respective frames within each respective subfolders and named the same way to avoid confusion. `masks` and `prediction` sets would be a (3D) tensor of dimension `(height x width x 3)` colored with respect to the spatial distribution of each class/label. As an example, please find here
```bash
/output   
└── prediction # Prediction data 
    ├── images
    ├── mask
    └── prediction
```
* `/models` is place to store and load the model weights. 



## Usage
* For training and prediction, refer to `train.sh` and `predict.sh` respectively to define necessary environment variables. 
```bash
# How to train? 
sh train.sh
# How to predict?
sh predict.sh
```
